        title="css wiki">CSS</a>) is a
    style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
    like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
    fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in
    the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
    specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
    structural content.
